# Web_Scraper-GUI
Name: POOJASHREE N

Domain: WEB DEVELOPMENT

Duration: August to September 2024

## Project 1: Full Page Web Scraper

### Overview

The project is a Tkinter-based GUI application that scrapes an entire webpage and extracts:

* All headings (h1 to h6)

* Paragraphs (p tags)

* Hyperlinks (a tags with href)

* Unordered (ul) and ordered (ol) list items (li)

It provides an interactive user interface to fetch and display the extracted data.

* Technologies Used

* Python

* Tkinter (GUI framework)

* Requests (for fetching webpage data)

* BeautifulSoup (for parsing HTML)

### Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. Then install the required libraries using:
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 
```

### How to Run
```
Save the script as full_page_scraper.py.
```
Open a terminal or command prompt in the script directory.

### Run the command:
```
python full_page_scraper.py
```
Click the "Scrape Website" button to extract webpage data.

# Project 2: H2 Headings Web Scraper

## Overview

The project extracts only h2 tags headings from a webpage and displays them in a GUI. It is useful for quickly fetching section titles from articles, blogs, or Wikipedia pages.

* Technologies Used

* Python

* Tkinter (GUI framework)

* Requests

* BeautifulSoup

### Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Then install the required libraries using:

```
